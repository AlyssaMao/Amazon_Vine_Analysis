## Summary

In conclusion, there does not appear to be any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program specific to the product line we've chosen, which is Beauty. This may be due to several reasons. Typically, shoppers that purchase beauty products from Amazon have found the product they want from other sources, and are less likely to be swayed by Vine reviews. This also goes to show that Vine program are typically used for products that have historically not been best selling, and as such shoppers are inclined to give fewer 5 star reviews after purchases because these are products that have never performed well for whatever reason. One additional analysis that I would love to do with the dataset to support my statement is to perform an analysis over the actual review language for negative/positive reviews. I hypothesis that the product lines within the vine program will likely have more negative reviews than positive ones.
